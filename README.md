# Parallel Matrix Multiplication Algorithms âš¡

Parallel and Serial Algorithms for matrix multiplication implemented in **C++ for GNU/Linux**. This implementation executes a serial algorithm along with two parallel algorithms: OpenMP and POSIX Threads. To run this program first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jc-juarez/parallel_matrix_multiplication
```

Then simply use the makefile provided within the repository:

```bash
make
```

And finally run the **output** executable:

```bash
./output
```

Tested in Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.
